# bootstraparse
Bootstraparse is a personal project started with a specific goal in mind: creating static html pages for direct display from a markdown-like file.
Bootstraparse aims to be customisable in that regard, but its first iteration and main focus will be to create a bootstrap-powered html.

Refer to the `example_userfiles` for an idea of what the parser expects you to feed it and `example_website` for the generated result.
